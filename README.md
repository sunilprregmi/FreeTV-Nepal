## Legal

No video files are stored in this repository. The repository simply contains publicly available video stream URLs. If any links in these playlists infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, they may be removed by sending a simple message at [My Telegram](https://t.me/guruusr). However, note that i/me have **no control** over the destination of the link, and just removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents from the web. Note that linking does not directly infringe copyright because no copy is made on the site providing the link, and thus this is **not** a valid reason to send a DMCA notice to GitHub. To remove this content from the web, you should contact the web host that's actually hosting the content (**not** GitHub, nor the maintainer/s of this repository).
